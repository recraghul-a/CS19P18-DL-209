Setting up VS Code with your Anaconda Environment
The key to using VS Code with Anaconda is to link your project to the specific Anaconda environment you created.

Install the Python Extension: If you haven't already, install the official Python extension from the VS Code Marketplace. This is a crucial step as it provides features like IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and environment management.

Open your Project Folder: In VS Code, open the folder where you want to keep your project files. This will be your workspace.

Select the Python Interpreter: This is the most important part.

Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS).

Type Python: Select Interpreter and press Enter.

A list of available Python interpreters will appear. You should see your Anaconda environment (e.g., tf_env: conda). Select it.

Once selected, the name of your environment will be displayed on the bottom-left of the VS Code status bar.

Open an Integrated Terminal: To run commands like pip install tensorflow, you'll use the integrated terminal in VS Code.

Open it by going to Terminal > New Terminal.

The terminal should automatically activate your selected Anaconda environment. You'll see the environment name in parentheses at the start of the command prompt (e.g., (tf_env) C:\...).

Now, you can run the pip install tensorflow command just as you would in the Anaconda Prompt.

Verify the Installation: Create a new Python file (e.g., test.py) and paste the verification code from the previous response.

Python

import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
