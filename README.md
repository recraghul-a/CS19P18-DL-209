# Deep Learning Experiments

## Description
This repository contains a series of deep learning experiments using TensorFlow and Keras, following a structured curriculum. Each experiment focuses on a core concept, from foundational neural networks to more advanced topics like generative models and object detection.

## Experiments
Installation of anoconda distribution and using it in vscode.

Simple Neural Network: A basic neural network classifier built with Keras and trained on the Iris dataset.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN model for image classification, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Handwritten Digit Recognition: A CNN for recognizing handwritten digits using the classic MNIST dataset.

Transfer Learning: A CNN using a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) to perform image classification on a new dataset.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): A SimpleRNN model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset.

Autoencoder: An unsupervised learning model to reconstruct images from a compressed representation, using the MNIST dataset.

Object Detection (YOLOv3): A script that uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 model with OpenCV to detect and localize objects in an image.

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): A basic GAN that trains a Generator and Discriminator to create new, realistic-looking images of handwritten digits.
